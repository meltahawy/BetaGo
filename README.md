# BetaGo
BetaGo is a python-based graphical user interface for the game of Go. It is built using Tkinter. Users can opt to play 2 player with a friend locally or they can play against BetaGo, an AI that is built with the Monte Carlo Search Tree technique and can run 500 simulations/sec. The GUI is flexible and users can opt to play on any size board they please. The game rules are as follows: no illegal ko moves, no suicides, and area scoring.
